### Projects
- [**AI-Driven-Framework-for-Predicting-Research-Trends**](https://github.com/keerti3/AI-Driven-Framework-for-Predicting-Research-Trends):  
Automated trend forecasting system analyzing scientific literature from ArXiv, PubMed & CrossRef using BERTopic, BERT embeddings, and LSTM models to detect emerging research areas and weak signals. Enables data-driven insights into evolving scientific discourse.

- [**Springboot-Config-Server-Microservices**](https://github.com/keerti3/Springboot-Config-Server-Microservices):
This project demonstrates a simple microservices architecture built with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Netflix OSS components, featuring client-side load balancing, service discovery, centralized configuration, distributed messaging, fault tolerance, error tracing, and monitoring.

## Highlights from My Journey  
**Graduate Research Assistant**, Georgia State University: Built a React.js Course Registration System that reduced enrollment inquiries by 50% and improved user task completion by 35%.  


**Software Developer**, Micron Technology: Optimized microservices with Spring Boot and Angular, integrated REST APIs, and implemented scalable ETL workflows on AWS. Reduced report runtimes and improved deployment pipelines.  


**SDE Intern**, Apple India: Enhanced Java EE backend with MySQL and Redis, built Python REST APIs, and deployed automated CI/CD pipelines for feature rollout and observability. 


**Cloud Intern**, Deeploop Technologies: Reduced cloud infrastructure costs by 58% through serverless AWS solutions and strengthened cloud security via IAM and KMS policies.
